But if we separate them from each other they want to reform and start to exert a potential of attraction called a potential difference.</p> <p>Now if we create a closed circuit these loose electrons will start to move and drift back to the protons due to their attraction creating a flow of electrons. This flow of electrons is called an electrical current. The electrons do not flow freely through the circuit as the material they move through creates a restriction to the electron flow. This restriction is called resistance.Then all basic electrical or electronic circuits consist of three separate but very much related electrical quantities called:</p> <ul> <li>Voltage: ( V )</li> <li>Current: ( i ) and </li> <li>Resistance: ( \u03a9 )</li> </ul>"},{"location":"DC/#electrical-voltage","title":"Electrical Voltage","text":""},{"location":"Ohms-Law/","title":"Ohms Law","text":"<p>Electrical current flowing through a fixed linear resistance is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and also inversely proportional to the resistance.</p> <p>By knowing any two values of the voltage, current, or resistance quantities we can use Ohms Law to find the third missing value.
