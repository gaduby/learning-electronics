Electrical current flowing through a fixed linear resistance is directly proportional to the voltage applied across it and also inversely proportional to the resistance.

By knowing any two values of the voltage, current, or resistance quantities we can use **Ohms Law** to find the third missing value. **Ohms Law** is used extensively in electronics formulas and calculations so it is very important to understand and accurately remember the following formulas:

**To find Voltage(V):**

*[V = I x R]*       V (volts) = I (amps) x R (Ω)

**To find Current(I):**

*[I = V ÷ R]*       I (amps) = V (volts) ÷ R (Ω)

**To find Resistance(R):**

*[ R = V ÷ I ]*     R (Ω) = V (volts) ÷ I (amps)
