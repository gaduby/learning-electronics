## DC

Basic DC circuit theory looks at how an electric circuit is an interconnection of electrical elements and that electrical current is the flow of charge, measured in amperes (A) being pushed around a closed circuit by a potential difference (electromotive force) known as voltage, measured in **volts (V)**.

All materials are made up from atoms, and all atoms consist of protons, neutrons, and electrons.

- **Protons** - have a positive electrical charge
- **Neutrons** - have no electrical charge
- **Electrons** - have a negative electrical charge

Atoms are bound together by powerful forces of attraction existing between the atoms nucleus and the electrons in its outer shell.

When these protons, neutrons and electrons are together within the atom they are happy and stable. But if we separate them from each other they want to reform and start to exert a potential of attraction called a **potential difference.**

Now if we create a closed circuit these loose electrons will start to move and drift back to the protons due to their attraction creating a flow of electrons. This flow of electrons is called an **electrical current.** The electrons do not flow freely through the circuit as the material they move through creates a restriction to the electron flow. This restriction is called **resistance.**Then all basic electrical or electronic circuits consist of three separate but very much related electrical quantities called:

- **Voltage:** ( V )
- **Current:** ( i ) and 
- **Resistance:** ( Î© )
